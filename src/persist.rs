//! Persist Gemma 4 weights into a REAL on-disk TribleSpace pile and load them
//! back from JUST the pile file — no safetensors needed at load time. This is the
//! "shell-is-physics endpoint": the weights live as content-addressed tribles on
//! disk, and a fresh process reconstructs the model from the pile alone.
//!
//! `persist_safetensors_to_pile` ingests every `*.safetensors` shard into the pile
//! (each tensor a content-addressed leaf at the selected storage dtype),
//! publishing the resulting fragment into Mary's signed model collection. The
//! weight *blobs* are written straight into the pile's storage (the `Pile` is itself a
//! `BlobStorePut`), so there is no giant in-memory buffer — only the small fact
//! set rides through the collection commit. It is fully model-agnostic — the
//! `gemma4` lineage in the old name was history; CLIP/SigLIP use the same path.
//!
//! `load_keymap_from_pile` opens the pile fresh, materializes the sole model
//! collection, finds every model entity (the ones
//! carrying `attrs::model_name`), and materializes the union keymap via
//! [`crate::ingest::load_keymap`]. Native BF16 consumers instead read typed
//! payload views, preserving the stored width and bits. BF16 checkpoint files
//! are mapped during import and must remain unchanged until it returns.
