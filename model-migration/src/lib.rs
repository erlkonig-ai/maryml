//! Strictly additive migration from Mary's legacy branch-model piles.
//!
//! The legacy `main` branch remains authoritative, byte-for-byte evidence. A
//! migration captures one exact branch head, checks out only that head's
//! ancestry, projects the audited pre-epoch attribute aliases, adds the
//! requested canonical selection coordinates at the already-existing model
//! root, and publishes the resulting union as one native model-collection
//! commit. It never pushes, creates, deletes, or otherwise advances a branch.
//!
//! The policy-transfer bridge likewise preserves exact retired descriptors
//! and COMMIT records. It recognizes only the audited pre-authority,
//! mandatory-authority, and identical direct independent-policy Mary shapes;
//! it re-signs only valid claims authored by the descriptor's single root.
//!
//! Storage policy stays with the caller: this crate takes an already-open
//! [`Pile`], never reopens it, and neither flushes nor closes it. The caller
//! supplies the signing key and chooses the explicit durability boundary.
//!
//! # Why this is a crate and not a `mary` module
//!
//! The migration is a one-way bridge across the legacy branch -> Collection
//! cutover. `mary` itself is past that cutover, while TribleSpace retains only
//! the read-only pin snapshot and branch/commit encodings required to inspect
//! old piles. Keeping the bridge in a standalone package prevents those
//! migration-only concepts from becoming runtime dependencies again.
